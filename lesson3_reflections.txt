When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm working with oher people or to keep a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If I'm working with someone else and they updated the same file. The changes I made locally may be erased if they're pulled automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - clone from a GitHub repository, references original repository
Cones - a copy of a whole repository
Branch - a version or part of a repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I may have messed up while editing so it's nice to have a good working copy to go back to
